# Flashcards

[Anki is one of my favorite flashcard tools.](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)

You can use the app and/or use the [website](https://ankiweb.net/about).

Here's a few links to shared decks that you may find useful:

- [https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/saa-c02](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/saa-c02)



Check out a few of these -- sort by Ratings & Modified.  I haven't built my own yet; but when I do, I'll add it... Until then, I don't have anything that I'd "recommend".



Quizlet also has qute a few
