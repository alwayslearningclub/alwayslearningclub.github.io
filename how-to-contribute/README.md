# How To Contribute

*This site is hosted using GitHub Pages (with Jekyll), we can leverage Git version control!* 


*Currently, this site is maintained by one person, so requests may take time.*


---


Currently, to submit any feature requests, resource updates or additions - you must have a GitHub account (*which is free*).

Look at the top of this page, you will see a pencil-tool icon...
If you are signed into your GitHub account, when you click on that button you will be taken directly to a page where you can submit tickets for updates, additions or feature requests.

Thank you so much for having interest in this project!!
